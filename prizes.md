# Prizes

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
 For each track, we will select winning groups for the top three positions: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places.</p>

- The first place winning group will receive a <b>\$10,000</b> cash prize,
- The second  place group will receive <b>\$5,000</b>, and
- The third place group will receive <b>\$2,000</b>.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Additionally, we will select three student awards per competition category, granted to the highest-ranking groups outside the top 3 positions, that are composed entirely of students. Each student group will receive $1,000 travel award to attend the workshop in person. Winners will be announced on the competition website as well as during the in-person workshop at NeurIPS.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The two first-place winning teams of each category will be invited to give a 30-minute presentation each during the in-person workshop at NeurIPS 2024, and all members of those teams will be offered a chance to co-author the report-out paper on this competition.</p>
