# Prizes

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
 For each of the two categories, we will select winning groups for the top three positions: 1st place, 2nd place, and 3rd place.</p>

- The first place winning group will receive a \$5,000 cash prize,
- The second  place group will receive \$2,500, and
- The third place group will receive \$1,000.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Additionally, we will select three student awards per competition category, granted to the highest-ranking groups outside the top 3 positions, that are composed entirely of students. Each student group will receive \$800 travel award to attend the workshop in person. Winners will be announced on the competition website as well as during the in-person workshop at NeurIPS.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The two first-place winning teams of each category will be invited to give a 30-minute presentation each during the in-person workshop at NeurIPS 2024, and all members of those teams will be offered a chance to co-author the report-out paper on this competition.</p>
