<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b> 1. Compression Challenge:</b> teams are tasked with developing their own compression methods to compress three pre-trained LLMs individually: Phi-2, Llama-3-8B, and Qwen-7B. Each model submitted must be capable of running on a smartphone device with 12 GB DRAM. Each model will be evaluated on a subset of the OpenCompass benchmark, which comprehensively assesses LLMs across multiple fundamental dimensions. For each task, the final submission score will be determined by calculating the average score of the three models involved. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b> 2. Training from Scratch Challenge:</b> teams are challenged to train language models from scratch without utilizing any pre-trained LLMs. There are no constraints on model architectures, training procedures, or duration, as long as the final models can run on a smartphone device with 12GB memory. Participants are free to design their architectures or utilize existing LLM architectures for this task. However, there is a restriction on the training data: only the C4 and Alpaca datasets are permitted for training and fine-tuning.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>Please note that quantization methods are not allowed</b> since 8-bit or 4-bit quantization for LLMs is a well-established technique. Participants must submit models in FP16 or FP32 format.
</p>

<h1 id="submission">Submission</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To participate in the challenge, you need to submit your entry by filling out a form. The form requires you to provide a link to your GitHub repository where your code is hosted. Additionally, you should <b> add our repository <i> edge-llms-challenge</i> as a collaborator on your repository</b>. This will allow us to access and review your code. </p>

<p>Here are the steps to complete the submission:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a GitHub repository for your project.</li>
  <li>Add your code to the repository.</li>
  <li>Fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/S367FfxUDcjSKz1Q9">submission form</a> with the required information, including the link to your GitHub repository.</li>
  <li>Add the edge-llm-challenge repository as a collaborator on your repository.</li>
  <li>Submit the form to complete your entry.</li>
</ol>

<p>By following these steps, you will have successfully submitted your entry for the challenge. Good luck!</p>

<h1 id="metrics">Metrics</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;">

To comprehensively evaluate submissions, we will employ a set of rigorously curated metrics, which include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Performance Score:</b> One of our primary scoring metrics is the performance score on the selected evaluation task. Each submission will be ranked individually for each task based on the performance score, with the top 10 submissions per task receiving scores from 10 to 1. The final score of the submission is calculated as the sum across all evaluation tasks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Memory Requirement:</b> The memory footprint during inference is a crucial metric for real-life edge devices. To qualify, the peak memory usage of all models must be less than 12GB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Throughput:</b> The throughput of an LLM typically refers to the rate at which the model can process input data and generate output tokens. It is often measured in terms of tokens per second. Throughput is a critical metric for evaluating the efficiency and performance of LLMs, especially in real-time or near-real-time applications where the speed of processing is crucial. Achieving high throughput implies that the model can handle large volumes of data quickly, making it suitable for tasks requiring rapid language processing, such as live chatbots, real-time translation, or speech recognition systems. This value will be measured on a smartphone with 12GB DRAM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Parameter count:</b> Submissions should also include the model size, expressed as the parameter count, to represent the model’s dimensions. This metric is used for information only, not for ranking.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="baseline-code-and-materials">Baseline, code, and materials</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The “starting kit” will be released to provide a starting point for people who are interested in our challenge before June 25th, 2024. This starting kit will provide detailed clarifications on what a submission looks like exactly, and how it will be evaluated and submitted. This starting kit will include an end-to-end submission flow, exemplified with a simple baseline:
 </p>

<ul>
  <li>Loading a large language model choosing from <b>Phi-2, Llama3-8B, or Qwen-7B</b>.</li>
  <li>Performing the basic L1 norm structured pruning on this model so that the compressed model can fit the smartphone.</li>
  <li>Evaluating the pruned model on the OpenCompass benchmark. We will provide an easy-to-tun pipeline for participants to evaluate their model on the subset of the OpenCompass benchmark.</li>
  <li>Deploying the resulting model on a smartphone platform and measuring its throughput. We will provide a tool that can help participants easily deploy their LLMs on the smartphone platform and measure throughput.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="datasets">Datasets</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This competition will not evaluate submissions based on the analysis of data. Our competition features two tracks: (1) post-training LLM compression for edge devices; and (2) training edge LLMs from scratch. We will allow participants to use and only use the C4 dataset and (Chinese) Alpaca for both tracks. The C4 dataset is a colossal, cleaned version of Common Crawl’s web crawl corpus, which is mainly intended to pre-train language models and word representations. Language models like MPT-7B and T5 are pre-trained with the C4 dataset. C4 is a large enough dataset that can make the competition interesting and draw conclusive and statistically significant results.  </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <b>C4 dataset</b> can be accessed through: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/c4">C4 dataset</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Chinese version of <b>Alpaca</b> can be accessed through: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/silk-road/alpaca-data-gpt4-chinese">Alpaca dataset</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
